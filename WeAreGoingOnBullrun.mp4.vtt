00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.917
Last year, the smoking tire went
on the Bull run Live rally

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.560
in the 2010 Ford SVT RAPT.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.837
I liked it so much, I bought one.
Here it is.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.597
We're going back to Bull run this year,
of course, with help from our

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:12.720
friends at Black Magic.

00:00:12.803 --> 00:00:17.760
We're so serious about it,
we got two Valentine One radar detectors.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:18.760
Oh, yeah.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.440
So we're all set up.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.160
And the reason we got two is because we're
going to be going a little bit faster.

00:00:25.243 --> 00:00:31.677
We got a 2011 Shelby GT 500 with a 550
horsepower, all aluminum V8.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.520
We are going to be right in the action,
bringing you guys a video every single

00:00:35.708 --> 00:00:39.480
day, live from the Bull Run Rally,
July ninth to 16th.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.920
And the only place to watch
it is on blackmagicShine.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.560
Com or right here on the smoking tire.
